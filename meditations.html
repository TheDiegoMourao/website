<h1 style="margin:20px;">choosing to make a website and on finishing projects</h1>
<h4 style="margin:20px">nov 24 2025, 9:23 - 10:08</h4>
<p style="margin:20px; word-wrap: break-word; width: 1000px;">
this started 4 weeks ago in a class of problématiques numériques, we had to choose a project and I thought about making a website.
i've been working on it every week, and now the site is almost done and now I'm wondering why I chose to do this in the first place. 
i have a tendency to sometimes start things and not finish. I always try to do things I truly want, which is great because it leads me to doing
a bunch of creative projects and other fun shit, but now it's like I don't really want to finish this site, and it's hard to project myself 
and imagining it be done. I And then I think I might as well do it for "me" 4 weeks ago, no? I don't know, it's a monday and 
I'm rethinking my whole life. I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want, and now I'm seeing if I can study 
psychology on the side. That sounds like a huge contradiction, and maybe it is but it kind of makes sense.
okay I just put on innerbloom. now I really want to finish this site and publish. I'm going to start publically showing my work more.
that's a big reason as to why I decided to make this. also I've always wanted a place to yap about whatever. I can technically do that anywhere okay
but I just found a reason to finish the site so keep it to yourself. you know what I just realized? my friends say I don't publish what I do, I don't share it.
and now I'm thinking, I'm an artist in 2025 and I'm not putting my shit out there? isn't that fucking crazy? i'm gonna say that again because I need to read it again, isn't 
that fucking crazy? borderline delusional. AND NOT IN THE GOOD KIND. anyways damn, it's monday morning and I have the sun to chase. 
I take way too long to do small ass tasks. I take a while to reply to messages and I'm not really sure why. but you know what I realize? since I take time 
to establish the foundation of the project, it has its legimate reason to exist. and you know rwhat, I'm listening to "la mente vola" and I'm realizing I'm going to live 
in the world I will have created. isn't that super fucking cool? I'm creating my paradise, and Headache says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8TN0OPBK-s&list=RDx8TN0OPBK-s&start_radio=1">if you want to know how paradise really feels, you have to try
somehow to be a little like a god</a>. that's my mantra today. I can control my thoughts, I can shape my future and I can create the world
I will live in. this is when I realize, I'm already living in it. until death all defeat is psychological. it's time to get up and live. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ488QrqGE4&list=RDLQ488QrqGE4&start_radio=1">"Shoot for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud"</a>,
I love that but now I'm going to forget the possiblity of landing on the cloud, my target is fixed and now with direction. in attempt to be more precise and direct, nothing too crazy,
I announce that I am now chasing the sun.
