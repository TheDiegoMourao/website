<h1 style="margin:20px";>it has to be now, export today, and we're so fucking back</h1>
<h4 style="margin: 20px;">february 15th 2026 04:17 or 04:27</h4>
<p style="margin:20px; word-wrap: break-word; width: 1000px">
this is writing number three. I officially consider myself a writer. i'm gonna make this all into a newsletter so goddamn gimme all your emails. anwyways
onto the real subject. here's some context: tonight I mixed at a bar for the first time in 6 months. <br>
<b>the BEFORE</b><br>
I woke up at 12 something. I got out of bed and onto my laptop, I had to choose songs that I was going to mix tonight. the genres were deep house / tech house. I prefer
tehcno but I do very much enjoy this too. it took me around 7 hours to download and get to know the songs I was going to mix. according to reddit you need minimum 20 songs
per hour, but more to always have a choice and adaptability. I had known this date was coming for around 2 weeks yet I waited until 2 days ago to start preparing. one reason 
is because I've started editing videos every day, and I really enjoy that and I think they will come out very nicely, every session I export whatever I created and this new
practice is really helping me out. even after waiting until the last day to do most of the prep I somehow found the time to scroll a shit ton. I'm not psychologist but this
has to be some of that self sabotage they talk about. or none of those fancy terms, just what the fuck was I doing? I haven't properly mixed in a few months, and I have a 
paid gig. (side note i would have said yes for a burger and a high-five) I felt drained for a good part of the day after my scrolling session and like I was advancing 
very slowly. I take a shower to reset, continue on for a bit then go walk and talk. I haven't put myself out there publically in so long. Last time I did it wasn't the best 
experience. and then it sort of clicked, was I really going to let one bad experience stop me from doing what I truly want to do? I'm not really sure if it's that but it kind
of made sense in the moment. I have lots of videos I've been hesitate to post, a sort of identity problem, "if i post this they'll think this or i'll only be this" which 
made me realize I was breaking my own mantra. It was fear. it was time to listen to my tattoo. I tatooed risk it on my body because if I started slacking I'd want me to
wake myself up. and you know what? 18 year old me was onto something. I experimented with a clothing brand and posting me mixing a few times. where's that now? it's
behind the scenes because I want to be "sure" and "the video isn't finished" (and yes on one hand it's strategy on the other hand it stunts its development)<br>
<b>the DURING/AFTER</b><br>
these were all thoughts that were concreticized (is this a word?) ((concrétisé)) during the mixing, which went fucking phenomenal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/On1chISoHzs">by the way</a>
(I didn't think I was going to put a link but here we are) SEE THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. THE IDEA EVOLVED WHEN I WENT TO MAKE IT PUBLIC. and it really made me realize
I'm scared of some stuff. and I imagined what sort of things I'd like to be doing with projects and the clothes and I imagine how I'd want them to be if I had no limits
and infinite money, and then I get demotivated to work because I'm not working on that huge project yet. but dude! you gotta go up the ranks ! if you wanna fight the enderdragon
you first gotta kill the blaze. oh and @emmy we really have to do that minecraft idea. it's gold. if we don't we'll watch someone else do it on youtube and think damn
that could have been us. and I freaking loved mixing. and there were friends that came and joined. much love to you. im gonna see if I have a photo hold on. I do not. 
but I will have a little video. WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT. <br>
every single day I have to advance a little bit. and when an idea comes to mind, I have to get it done, as much as possible. for the big ones it's a bit more complicated
(i filmed a lot today and have an idea on how to edit but that'll take time) BUT I thought about writing this post and I realized oh shit it's low effort to start. now i've
been here for okay shit. it's 4:40. I wrote down that I started writing this at 04:57. I wrote in negative time. (i should sleep) and I think it's very important to do
so. If you have it, get it done and now I'm free to move onto my next one when it comes. <br>
I think I'm ready to start posting more stuff again. or maybe not but I know I have to. I at least need to do it to truly know if I don't want to and let's be honest I do.
there's gonna be a small video on tonight because it was full of shenanigins anyways sleep tight everyone<br>
I just re-read this. this is a little uncomprehensible. but I understood it. and there'll be a video. anyways. bisouschke as I learned we say.
much love

<p style="margin:20px; word-wrap: break-word; width: 1000px;">
My birthday was 2 days ago so as usual im questioning my whole fucking existence. there's different things I want to do, 
or finally do, and I look at myself and I'm like wtf am I doing you know? There's different things I say I want to do but when the time finally 
comes around I'm not really getting to it. What the fuck? My lifes fucking great to be honest I'm in paris right now I've been eating good ass 
food and have expositions planned so shits going to be great. But I feel like I'm losing my mind whether it be structure or whatever, and even 
though I'm studying art no one here is going to be holding my hand and telling me what I need to do and shit so I just need to fucking do it,
 even though I'm not sure whatever the fuck it is. where the fuck is my math teacher yelling at me for not doing my homework when I really need it?
 and the way I think my mind works is I start doing something and It's telling me to do 4 
 other things at the same time, I have 9 fucking Microsoft word documents all on different things, looking at it from an outer perspective 
 I'm like what the actual fuck ? and there's already a writing I wanted to put on here but I haven't already and I just stare at it, wondering 
 if it's the right move or not but at the same time since I'm just fucking staring at it and staring at all these 9 other documents and whatever 
 idea of project I want to do, I stay in the whole “conception” of it al instead of all the movement and I think that's getting to me. So you 
 know what this might not make much fucking sense but I think I needed to write something so I'm gonna put it on the site, I'm trying to do so 
 much fucking shit and I don't know where to start so I think I just need to start and I think this is a thought I have every day and everyday 
 I think I understand it different but clarity isn't action so fucking here we are sorry mom for all the times I said fuck I just feel very passionately 
 about this and it felt very fucking appropriate

TIME TO UPLOAD THIS BEFORE I START QUESTIONING IT

and now this cycle has gotten so bad that I don't even want to mention projects that are on-going because what if I'm just like mmmmm? you know? so fuck it I'm not sure if
I should mention everything or nothign but come back in a little bit to this site or instagram (if I dont end up deleting it) and look at whats been going on

much love to everyone my days actually been really fucking good I just had that in my mind

oh AND i may not have my math teacher but I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9KPKIeO_NR4">joey diaz yelling at you</a> and for that extra sauce of motivation 
if once you're moving may I suggest the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO14VSx74MU">german ww2 soldier making sure you study</a>

<h1 style="margin:20px;">choosing to make a website and on finishing projects</h1>
<h4 style="margin:20px">nov 24 2025, 9:23 - 10:08</h4>
<p style="margin:20px; word-wrap: break-word; width: 1000px;">
this started 4 weeks ago in a class of problématiques numériques, we had to choose a project and I thought about making a website.
i've been working on it every week, and now the site is almost done and now I'm wondering why I chose to do this in the first place. 
i have a tendency to sometimes start things and not finish. I always try to do things I truly want, which is great because it leads me to doing
a bunch of creative projects and other fun shit, but now it's like I don't really want to finish this site, and it's hard to project myself 
and imagining it be done. I And then I think I might as well do it for "me" 4 weeks ago, no? I don't know, it's a monday and 
I'm rethinking my whole life. I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want, and now I'm seeing if I can study 
psychology on the side. That sounds like a huge contradiction, and maybe it is but it kind of makes sense.
okay I just put on innerbloom. now I really want to finish this site and publish. I'm going to start publically showing my work more.
that's a big reason as to why I decided to make this. also I've always wanted a place to yap about whatever. I can technically do that anywhere okay
but I just found a reason to finish the site so keep it to yourself. you know what I just realized? my friends say I don't publish what I do, I don't share it.
and now I'm thinking, I'm an artist in 2025 and I'm not putting my shit out there? isn't that fucking crazy? i'm gonna say that again because I need to read it again, isn't 
that fucking crazy? borderline delusional. AND NOT IN THE GOOD KIND. anyways damn, it's monday morning and I have the sun to chase. 
I take way too long to do small ass tasks. I take a while to reply to messages and I'm not really sure why. but you know what I realize? since I take time 
to establish the foundation of the project, it has its legimate reason to exist. and you know rwhat, I'm listening to "la mente vola" and I'm realizing I'm going to live 
in the world I will have created. isn't that super fucking cool? I'm creating my paradise, and Headache says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8TN0OPBK-s&list=RDx8TN0OPBK-s&start_radio=1">if you want to know how paradise really feels, you have to try
somehow to be a little like a god</a>. that's my mantra today. I can control my thoughts, I can shape my future and I can create the world
I will live in. this is when I realize, I'm already living in it. until death all defeat is psychological. it's time to get up and live. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ488QrqGE4&list=RDLQ488QrqGE4&start_radio=1">"Shoot for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud"</a>,
I love that but now I'm going to forget the possiblity of landing on the cloud, my target is fixed and now with direction. in attempt to be more precise and direct, nothing too crazy,
I announce that I am now chasing the sun.
