  my parents named me Diego! some people call me the mayor of Vevey! i think here i'm supposed to define myself but defining myself would 
  be delimiting myself and I hate limits. i'm creating stuff while I study fine arts in geneva, work at a bar and everything else a 21 year old has to do.
  i was studying political science and then i stopped to chase art school. i didn't get in but i tried again. that worked. 
  i have big aspirations and sometimes they make me go crazy. but most of the time they make me feel like i'm flying. i'll be presenting my stuff on this site. 
  feel free to look at everything. feel free to look at nothing. i'm really not sure if this site is for my friends or for strangers.
  maybe it's for people who aren't in my life anymore, if they ever wonder where I'm at and if I'm doing what I said I would. maybe it's for me. maybe i don't have to know.
